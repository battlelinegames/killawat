# KillaWAT
Killa' WAT is a (not ready for prime time) WebAssembly Text Macro Assembler and Low-level Wasm compiler

## Not ready for general use
I'm still working on this as a hobby project.  I'm making some good progress, but I'm guessing this won't be ready for general use until early 2022.  If you are interested in playing around with what I have, please let me know on Twitter: (@battagline)
